                        Google Student Ambassador and an alumni of University of Moratuwa, Akshika Wijesundara. SEF was
                        founded with the short term goal of making the Sri Lankan education system the most effective
                        and the most dynamic education system in the world. SEF’s final goal is to disrupt and
                        democratize the global education system where it is available for everyone, in doing so
                        foundation contributes to the United Nations’ sustainable development goal of “Quality
                        Education”.

                        One of the interesting and powerful qualities of SEF is that they have utilized social media to
                        carry out of most their programs. In order to achieve their goals, SEF has conducted many
                        programs to empower students, educational institutes and education as a whole in Sri Lanka. Some
                        of the programs SEF has done are as follows.
